# Unsupervised-ML-Methods
## 1️⃣ K-Means Clustering
* Loaded the USArrests dataset.
* Checked for missing values and explored the dataset.
* Applied K-Means clustering with different numbers of clusters.
* Visualized the clusters and cluster centers.
* Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## 2️⃣ Hierarchical Clustering
* Used Complete-Linkage and Average-Linkage methods.
* Generated dendrograms to visualize the hierarchical clustering process.

## 3️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Loaded the Hitters dataset and standardized it.
* Performed PCA to reduce dimensionality.
* Analyzed the explained variance of principal components.
* Determined the optimal number of components using a cumulative variance plot.

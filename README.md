# Unsupervised-ML-Methods
1️⃣ K-Means Clustering
* Loaded the USArrests dataset.
* Checked for missing values and explored the dataset.
* Applied K-Means clustering with different numbers of clusters.
* Visualized the clusters and cluster centers.
* Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
2️⃣ Hierarchical Clustering
Used Complete-Linkage and Average-Linkage methods.
Generated dendrograms to visualize the hierarchical clustering process.
3️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Loaded the Hitters dataset and standardized it.
Performed PCA to reduce dimensionality.
Analyzed the explained variance of principal components.
Determined the optimal number of components using a cumulative variance plot.
